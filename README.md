#faceJam

##Team Members: David Daniels, Marcus Johnson, Andrea Velardi

##Project Description: This project generates a song to match your mood. The user will upload their own photo via the upload form, using file type valiation. We use the face recognition API, Face++, to capture your expression in the photo and quantify your mood based on an algorithm of emotions. The highest scoring emotion will be used as the indicator for song choice from the SoundCloud API. The song played will be displayed in a table, listing; song title, artist, and release date. There will also be a sound bar displayed at bottom of the screen to pause, skip, and play. The play button will turn into a pause button will audio is playing.
